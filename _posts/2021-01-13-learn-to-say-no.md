title: Learn to say No
categories: [behavior]
---

Last year, I'd been writing some ideas, some thoughts, and behaviors that I have had.

One of the most powerful words that I learned is to say **no**. Simple, right. But when your manager says to you: I need this to Monday morning. You just realized that you probably need to work on the weekend. So I write this to my notebook:

> If something is not possible, say no.

> If you are not sure, say no.

> There is no try. You can, or you can't.

You need to see the whole context, evaluate everything, and clarify your communication. Do not create doubt.
