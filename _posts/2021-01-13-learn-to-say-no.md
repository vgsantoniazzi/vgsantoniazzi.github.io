title: Learn to say No
categories: [behavior]
---

Last year, I'd been writing some ideas, some thoughts, and behaviors that I have had.

One of the most powerful words that I learned is to say is **"no"**. Simple, right. 

When your manager says to you: I need this to Monday morning. You just realized that you probably need to work over the weekend. It is not alright if it is not vital. Be careful about the thin line "vital" here.

So I write this to my notebook with personal notes:

> If something is not possible, say no.

> If you are not sure, say no.

> There is no try. You can, or you can't.

You need to comprehend the whole context, evaluate everything, and clarify your communication. 

Do not create doubt.
