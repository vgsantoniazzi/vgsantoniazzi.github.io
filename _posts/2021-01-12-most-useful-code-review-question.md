title: Best Code Review Question
categories: [behavior]
---

I've been reviewing code for the last ten years. My GitHub chart is about 32% of code review and 29% of pull requests. Does this lead to a question: How many pull requests I created or reviewed?

I was querying GitHub to get some metrics about this, and the result is excellent. I reviewed or created about 6500 pull requests as a software engineer.

I believe that code review — and code review feedback is one of the most critical soft skills for a software engineer. Provide useful feedback, ask questions properly, be polite, show respect, and understand what others think about this piece of software — In other words, understanding how your teammate thinks, is probably the most required skill nowadays.

## First things first

When I submit a pull request, I usually do the best thing that I could do with my knowledge, resources, and context. But sometimes it is not so good as I think it was.

It isn't easy to understand other peoples' information, and sometimes the code or the review is not self-explainable. I have a phrase that solves 90% of my questions:

> What would be helpful?

And almost the answer is a piece or working (or schema) well explained about what is, in fact, helpful.

## From reviewer perspective

If I don't understand a piece of code that I am reading, probably my question would be

> Nice. I think that could be done in a different direction:

> Do you that it would be helpful?

## From a reviewee perspective

There is a current discussion, and I don't understand the reviewer's perspective.

> Thanks for your review. It is not clear to me what I should do. What would be helpful?

And you, magically, receive a direction, schema, code, or whatever you are asking.

> Would be useful if ....?

> What do you think would be beneficial in this case?

> Would it be better if I implement it in this way?
